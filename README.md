# 📚 Headless CMS Review Site — Srishti Sharma

This project is a simple Headless CMS-style web application created for the **MTM6407 Web Development IV – Headless CMS Assignment**.  
Instead of connecting to a real CMS platform (like Contentful or Strapi), this version uses a local JSON file (`reviews.json`) to simulate content being delivered from an API.

The goal is to demonstrate:
- How content can live separately from the frontend  
- How the UI dynamically loads and displays data  
- How filtering and rendering logic works using JavaScript

## ✨ Project Description

This project is a **Review Website** that displays different types of reviews such as:
- Books  
- Movies  
- Video games  

All content is stored in a structured JSON file, mimicking a real headless CMS.

The user can:
- View all reviews  
- Filter reviews by category  
- Dynamically reload content  
- See ratings, titles, authors, and descriptions  

The UI is clean, responsive, and easy to navigate.
